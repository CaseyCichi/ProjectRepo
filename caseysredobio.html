			<h2> About Myself </h2>
				<p>Hello! My name is Casey, and I am 20 years old studying at miramar college. I am a pretty indecisive person,therefore, when I first got out of highschool I had a very different vision of what I wanted versus what I want today. I started studying graphic arts and design and did lots of free lance work including packaging and logo designing. I enjoyed my time doing that but soon realized that i needed more of a transferable skill so I started studying buisness administration. I took buisness admin classes for a year and a half and realized that I really didn't enjoy it so that brings me to the present! I am currently studying informatics/computer science and and really enjoy it! 
				</p>

				<p>Some hobbies that I really enjoy are playing volleyball and playing video games. Some of the games I play include, the final fantasy series and OSU. Final Fantasy is an mmo game and OSU is a rhythm game. I also enjoy going to open gyms to play volleyball during the week.
				</p>
